# Wall_E
Future Fuels Wall_E robot code

Wall_E tests -> The first test file is simply a test to check if the robot will run properly and move in a line, turn, etc, so that we can figure out how fast to have the motors run and how long to have them run for.

Wall_E Ultra -> The Ultra tests test the working of the ultrasonic sensors, and how we're going to get the robot to adjust
